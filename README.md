This project is a simulation of the behavior of a tractor with built-in artificial intelligence. The tractor itself raises the decision of its further actions based on the conditions inside the simulation. 
ID3 and A-star algorithms are implemented in the project. The tractor can independently recognize and classify objects located in the image.

The project itself was originally located on the git repository of my faculty: https://git.wmi.amu.edu.pl/s473603/SztIn_gr.234798
The data used to train the neural network was taken from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/misrakahmed/vegetable-image-dataset
